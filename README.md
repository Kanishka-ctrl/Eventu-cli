# Eventu - Event Management System

Eventu is a comprehensive event management system built using PHP. It facilitates both the **client-side** and **server-side** functionalities required to manage events, book tickets, generate passes, and maintain a streamlined process for event organizers and attendees alike.

## Features

### Client-Side Features
- **Event Browsing**: Users can view detailed information about upcoming and past events, including dates, venue details, descriptions, and ticket prices.
- **Ticket Booking**: Clients can book tickets for events. Users receive confirmation and e-tickets upon successful booking.
- **Pass Generation**: After booking tickets, users can generate event passes that can be shown at the event venue for entry.
- **View Booked Tickets**: Clients can check their previously booked tickets and manage their bookings.
  
### Server-Side Features (Admin Panel)
- **Event Creation**: Admins can create new events by specifying details like event name, date, time, venue, and ticket prices.
- **Event Updates**: Admins can update the details of existing events, including descriptions, availability, and schedules.
- **Event Deletion**: Outdated or canceled events can be deleted from the system.
- **Booking Management**: Admins can monitor and manage ticket bookings for each event.
- **Pass Validation**: Admins can validate the passes generated by users during the event check-in.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: PHP (Server-side scripting)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL (for storing event details, bookings, and user information)
- **Other Tools**: AJAX for dynamic content updates, Bootstrap for styling
